# Machine-Learning-Approach-For-Musical-Therapy-Using-Facial-Expressions


Human’s emotions like happiness, anger, sadness, fear, depression and tenderness can typically be determined through their facial expressions. Music could change human’s emotions, could have an
influence on their mood, and finally could affect their health. Musical Therapy is one among the oldest strategies used for treating some of the psychological diseases. The combination of Musical therapy
and facial emotion detection results in an intelligent system that sorts a music collection based on the genre conveyed by each music and then recommends a well-suited music playlist to the psychiatrist
for the patients based on their current mood.

Everyone prefers to listen to music depending on their mood. But manually selecting a song according to mood is a progressive and timetaken task that should be tackled. The system will
suggest songs to the user according to their mood by capturing facial expressions. We develop an application to create a playlist automatically. The existing model contains Viola Jones
algorithm for face detection and Fisher faces classifier for emotion classification, ,it gives 80 percentage of accuracy where as The proposed approach is to use the person's facial emotions
such as happy, sad, neutral, and angry as input and produce a piece of appropriate music as output. Facial expressions are delivered using an integrated camera. This is an intelligent music
player who continues to learn your visual habits and plays all the songs accordingly. The results show that the proposed system reaches up to 94.82% precision in expression recognition using
the convolutional neural network.
